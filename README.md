# Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset

Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment of Course 1 of the Deep Learning Specialization! You'll be building a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats (meow!). This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning. By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to classify your own photo as cat/not cat (meow?).
